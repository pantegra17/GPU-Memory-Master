# GPU Memory Master
GPU Memory Master is a professional technical analysis tool developed for graphics card enthusiasts, system builders, and hardware editors. It allows you to decipher complex memory architectures and verify the raw processing power of GPUs using limited available data.

🛠 Key Features

Intelligent VRAM Decoder

Missing Data Completion: By entering any two of the Effective Speed ​​(Gbps), Bus (Bit), or Bandwidth (GB/s) values, it accurately calculates the missing third value in seconds.

Full Compliance with GDDR7 Standards: Supports the latest memory technologies. It guarantees technical accuracy by separately reporting the critical WCK (Write Clock - 16x) and CK (Command Clock - 32x) speeds for the GDDR7 architecture.

Precise TFLOPS Analysis

FP32 (Single Precision) Calculation: Using GPU core count (Cuda/SP/ALU) and Boost clock speed (OC) data, it calculates the card's theoretical processing power using industry-standard formulas.

VRAM Capacity Guide

Bus Analysis: Provides information notes on the ideal VRAM capacities expected on a graphics card based on the selected bit value (e.g., 128-bit, 256-bit).
